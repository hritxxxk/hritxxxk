## Production Systems

### AI-Powered Product Intelligence System

Multimodal AI using CLIP + BLIP with Gemini API fallback, combined with agentic web search to automate PIM data entry.

**Impact**:
- 30 seconds per product (down from hours)
- Deployed for 10+ enterprise clients including Marks & Spencer and Titan Eyewear
- Full AWS deployment - APIs and hosting

**Tech**: `CLIP` `BLIP` `Gemini API` `Agentic Search` `AWS` `Python`

### Hostile Data Compiler

ETL pipeline that accepts any data format no matter how broken and transforms it into PIM-ready templates. Handles data from Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon SP, FSP, SFTP, and Google Drive.

**Impact**:
- 10,000 products processed in 20 minutes
- Reduced months of work to hours
- Full AWS deployment end-to-end

**Tech**: `Python` `ETL` `Multi-source APIs` `AWS`

### Data Transformation Engine

Tools to transform unstructured and broken product data into structured insights for product creation.

**Impact**:
- Unlocked team productivity
- Validated strong data intuition and foundational statistics skills

---

## Philosophy

**Data preprocessing is everything** - If you understand your data manually and regularly, you become the pattern recognition system, then the AI you build actually works.

**AI is underutilized** - Most "AI is stupid" complaints are "I'm using AI wrong" problems. The issue is implementation, not capability.

**Theory plus practice** - Statistical foundations make new AI technologies easier to understand and implement quickly.

---

## Track Record

- **5 models** deployed to production
- **10+ enterprise clients** including Marks & Spencer, Titan Eyewear
- **Full AWS infrastructure** deployment and hosting
- **Months to hours** in workflow automation improvements

---

## Current Work

Advancing the Hostile Data Compiler - making it more robust at handling any data format, any structure, any level of brokenness.

Focus areas - multimodal AI for product intelligence, hostile data transformation, workflow automation with real user impact, statistically validated models.

## What I'm Looking For

Open to full-time opportunities, freelance projects, collaborations, technical discussions.

Best projects - where AI impacts user experience and makes difficult tasks easier.
