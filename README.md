## 📁 Featured Projects

**Churn Prediction using Sentiment Analysis**  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using sentiment analysis techniques. By analyzing customer sentiment expressed in reviews and feedback, the aim is to identify patterns that can predict which customers are more likely to churn. Python has been extensively used to implement the sentiment analysis algorithms.

**LangChain - Building a Question-Answering (QA) System**  
LangChain is a project that integrates a language model with a chained deep learning approach to build an advanced Question Answering (QA) system. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to answer questions accurately. The project showcases my knowledge and skills in NLP and deep learning frameworks.

**Classification of Anemia using Machine Learning Techniques**  
In this project, machine learning techniques are applied to classify anemia based on available patient data. By using an appropriate model, the aim is to accurately determine the presence and severity of anemia. Python and R have been utilized to build the classification models.
